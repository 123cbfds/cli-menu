### Installation

```php
composer require phpschool/cli-menu
```

### Usage

The PhpSchool elephpants are working hard on delivering a top notch learning experience on the command line. 
While we do that documentation is being neglected so please take a look at the examples to find out how to use this. 

### Tests

We're amazing developers who don't need tests...

Joking aside, we're big advocates of testing so these are in the pipeline, bare with us, we just did this a bit backwards :)
